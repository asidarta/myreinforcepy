## myreinforcepy
This is a folder that contains scripts used to run behavioral studies with the inMotion robot. The experiments were done as part of my PhD projects @ Motor Control Lab, McGill. The scripts are considered the 2nd generation of codes based on an earlier version created in Tcl language.

1. "audio" contains instruction files (.wav).
2. "data" contains all recorded logfiles.
3. "exper_design" contains settings relevant for the experiment.
4. "pictures" contains image files used in the experiment.
5. "questionaires" contains questionaires for the participants.
6. "robot" is probably the most important folder (by floris) that manages communication with the physical robot. It was derived from the old suzuki machine but now adapted for python-based coding instead of Tcl.

Outside of those folders, there are python codes used in the various experiment. Example: my_WMTest.py for both somatic and visual working memory, my_MotorFF.py for both motor adaptation and parallel bar/reinforcement-based study.
